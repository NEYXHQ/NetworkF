# Profile Completion Feature Setup Guide

This guide covers the setup for the new Profile Completion feature that asks users what they're looking for in the WFounders network.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Updates Required

Run this SQL in your **Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor**:

```sql
-- Add profile completion fields to the users table
ALTER TABLE public.users 
ADD COLUMN looking_for TEXT,
ADD COLUMN profile_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;

-- Create index for profile completion for faster queries
CREATE INDEX idx_users_profile_completed ON public.users (profile_completed);

-- Add comments for documentation
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.users.looking_for IS 'What the founder is looking for in the network (co-founder, investors, mentors, etc.)';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.users.profile_completed IS 'Whether the founder has completed their profile (what they are looking for)';

-- Update existing users to mark profile as incomplete by default
-- (This ensures existing users will see the profile completion modal)
UPDATE public.users SET profile_completed = false WHERE profile_completed IS NULL;
```

## üîÑ User Flow

The profile completion feature follows this sequence:

1. **User logs in** via Web3Auth
2. **Survey Modal** appears for new users (if `survey_completed = false`)
3. **Profile Completion Modal** appears after survey (if `survey_completed = true` but `profile_completed = false`)
4. **User Profile** shows normally once both are completed

## üéØ Profile Completion Options

Users can choose from these predefined options:

- **Co-founder** - Looking for someone to build my company with
- **Investors** - Seeking funding for my startup  
- **Mentors** - Want guidance from experienced founders
