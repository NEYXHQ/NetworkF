   ```

### Step 3: Test the Integration

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding More Social Providers

Web3Auth supports 15+ social providers out of the box:
- Google, Facebook, Twitter
- GitHub, LinkedIn, Discord  
- Apple, Line, Kakao
- Auth0, AWS Cognito, Firebase
- And more...

Just enable them in your Web3Auth dashboard.

### Changing Blockchain Networks

The default is Ethereum, but you can easily switch:

```typescript
// In src/contexts/Web3AuthProvider.tsx
const web3authInstance = new Web3Auth({
  clientId: config.web3AuthClientId,
  web3AuthNetwork: WEB3AUTH_NETWORK.SAPPHIRE_MAINNET,
  // Add chain config for other networks
});
```

Supported: Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche, BSC, and 50+ more.

### Styling

All components use Tailwind CSS and are easily customizable:

```tsx
// Example: Change primary color from blue to purple
className="bg-purple-600 hover:bg-purple-700"
```

## 📝 Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production (outputs to `dist/`)
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## 🔍 For Founder Verification

Since you're building for verified founders/entrepreneurs:

1. **User authenticates** with Web3Auth (social login)
2. **You get their profile data** from the social provider
3. **Implement your verification process** (manual review, criteria checking, etc.)
4. **Grant access** to verified users only

The wallet is created immediately, but you control access to your app's features.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Web3Auth Issues
- Verify your Client ID is correct
- Check that your domain is added to Web3Auth dashboard
- Ensure you're using the Plug-and-Play Web3Auth type

### Build Issues
- Large bundle size is normal (Web3Auth includes crypto libraries)
- Use dynamic imports if you need to optimize further

### Deployment Issues
